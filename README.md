This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The program checks for win conditions after each move and displays the result.
